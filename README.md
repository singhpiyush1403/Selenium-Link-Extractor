# Selenium-Link-Extractor
This project demonstrates how to extract and print all hyperlinks from a webpage using Selenium WebDriver in Java. It navigates to a demo site, counts the total number of &lt;a> tags, and retrieves their visible text. The script also prints the page title and current URL for validation.
